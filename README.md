Smart Flush üöΩ
Smart Flush is an automated, water-efficient sanitation system designed for public restrooms with Western-style toilets. Created as part of Smart India Hackathon 2024 (Problem Statement ID: SIH1546), it provides an innovative solution to optimize water usage, boost hygiene, and ensure sustainability through advanced technology and automation.

Features üåü
Automatic Presence Detection: Triggers functions like flushing and cleaning without manual input.
Waste Type Detection: Adjusts water use based on the type of waste for maximum efficiency.
Automatic Cleaning Jets: Ensures superior hygiene by cleaning the toilet after each use.
Automated Lid Operation: Provides a hands-free, seamless user experience.
Solar Power System: Fully powered by solar energy, reducing reliance on traditional electricity.
Sensors and Components Used üõ†Ô∏è
The Smart Flush system is powered by the following sensors and components:

MPR121 (Touch Sensor): Detects user presence and touch-based interactions.
HC-SR04 (Ultrasonic Sensor): Measures distance to identify waste type for efficient flushing.
Motion Sensor: Detects movement to trigger lid and cleaning operations.
5V DC Solenoid Valve: Controls water flow during flushing.
Arduino Microcontroller: Serves as the system's brain, integrating and controlling all components.
Servo Motor: Operates the toilet lid and cleaning jets for automation.
